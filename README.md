# Crowdfunding_Analysis
Organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

Overview
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s.
To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal.
From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

1.)	One conclusion is that there were a grand total of 1000 campaigns, and we can say for a fact that the majority of the crowdfunding campaigns turned out to be Successful.
2.)	To follow up from the first statement, Theater was the most successful as well as the most failed campaign. The plays were both a success with some failure.
3.)	Journalism was the only category without any live, failed or cancelled campaigns but did only have four successful ones.

•	What are some limitations of this dataset?

There could have been a third category to give more detail on the type of genre, type of games, types of food, etc. To give an example, from the Theater campaign, and its subcategory plays, another category with comedy, tragedy, historical and even musical would given us more data on which plays were the most successful, but this example could be done for every category.


•	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

Another pivot table of people could be created about which different age groups along with gender determined the outcome of the categories were successful, failed or cancelled. The value of this is finding out what age group of people are attracted to what category of content.
